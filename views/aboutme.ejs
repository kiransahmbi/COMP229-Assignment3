      I've always had a drive for automation and optimizing processes. It's no surprise that I found myself programming
      in order to solve business problems and inefficiencies at the workplace.<br><br>

      My background is in Chemical Engineering, however I've decided to finally pursue my passion - programming. 
      My journey began as self-taught, and I've now pursued formal education in Software Engineering to cement my skills.<br><br>

      My projects range from web development, desktop development, to data analysis projects. Please take a look at my resume below!
